# Project: Personal Secure Wormholes (PSWs)

A PSW is a cryptographically secure tunnel for encapsulating direct interactions between applications running in the personal networks of the end-users. However, no network integration should be required: the applications from each end-user network should be able to interact with each other without reconfiguring their networks. New applications can be strongly integrated with the exploitation of PSW, while existing applications may be able to exploit them transparently.
